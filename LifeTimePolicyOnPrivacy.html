Privacy Policy for Life Time

LPG Creations built the Life Time app as a free application. 
This service is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.

Information Collection and Use

At present, Life Time does not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information from its users.

In the future, we may integrate third-party advertising services (such as Google AdMob) to support the continued development of the app. 
These services may collect certain information as described in their own privacy policies (for example, device identifiers, usage data, or location-based information for personalized ads). 
You will be notified within the app if such integrations occur.

Third-Party Services

If we integrate advertising or analytics services, they may collect information in accordance with their own privacy policies. 
For example:

*Google Play Services
*AdMob

Childrenâ€™s Privacy

Life Time is not directed to children under the age of 13. 
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. 
If we discover that a child under 13 has provided personal information, we will delete it immediately.
